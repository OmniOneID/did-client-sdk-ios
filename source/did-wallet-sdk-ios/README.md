## Build Method
: Open a terminal and run the script `build_xcframework.sh` to build XCFramework.
1. Launch the Terminal app and type the following: 
```groovy
$ ./build_xcframework.sh
```
2. Once the archive is complete, a `DIDWalletSDK.xcframework` file will be created in the `release/` folder.

## SDK Application Method
1. Copy the `DIDWalletSDK.xcframework` file to the framework directory of the app project. 
2. Add the frameworks to your app project dependencies.
    ```groovy
    DIDWalletSDK.xcframework
    ```
3. Set the frameworks to `Embeded & Sign`.
4. In the app projectâ€™s `Package Dependencies`, click the `+` to add the following items.
    ```groovy
    https://github.com/apple/swift-collections.git
    Exact Version 1.1.4
    ```

## Optimization
There is an optimization issue related to BigInt when using ZKP-related functions.
- This is not an issue when using `DIDWalletSDK.xcframework`.
- When referencing and using the `DIDWalletSDK` project, there is a delay in all APIs that perform ZKP-related operations.
- To resolve this issue, the `Build Configuration` should be changed to `Release`.
